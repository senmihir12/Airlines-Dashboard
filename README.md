✈️ Airlines Dashboard Project (Tableau)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes flight pricing, duration, and booking patterns using a dataset of 300,000+ airline records sourced from Kaggle. The dashboards were created in Tableau to derive insights that are highly relevant for:

Airlines & Travel Companies → understanding market pricing, customer booking behavior, and route demand.

Business Analysts / Data Analysts → exploring data-driven decision-making with interactive dashboards.

Recruiters & Hiring Managers → assessing my ability to work with real-world datasets, create meaningful KPIs, and design interactive dashboards for storytelling.
